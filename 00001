/*
++from char to int++
String element = "el5";
int x = Character.getNumericValue(element.charAt(2));
System.out.println("x=" + x);

++from char to string++
You can use Character.toString(char). Note that this method simply returns a call to String.valueOf(char), which also works.
As others have noted, string concatenation works as a shortcut as well:
String s = "" + 's';
